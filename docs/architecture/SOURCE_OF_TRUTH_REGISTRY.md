# CEO's OS / The Sovereign OS — Source of Truth Registry

## Purpose

Official registry of source-of-truth for data, calculations, permissions, modules, and executive signals.

This document defines intended ownership and known risks. It does not certify that current code implementation is correct until C.13 validation completes.

## Documentation Truthfulness

Every entry must use one of these statuses:

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Confirmed | Verified by audit or explicit architectural invariant |
| Assumed / Pending C.13 validation | Likely source; code audit not yet complete |
| Known duplicate risk | Two sources may disagree |
| Known demo/fallback contamination risk | Demo or fallback may appear as real |
| Source unclear | Cannot determine without deeper audit |
| Deprecated | Must not be used for new work |
| Human review required | DSS/heuristic; not certified output |

Do not mark Assumed entries as Confirmed before C.13.

## Core Source-of-Truth Table

| Compliance weightedRiskScore | explicable 3-dimension score | Golden Dataset + Formula Registry (`COMPLIANCE_WEIGHTED_RISK`) | Canonical (docs) / Pending implementation | No helper in code yet | compliance_weighted_risk_score_basic | C.13.1C-f1B Option C |
| Compliance operationalRiskScore | dashboard operational score | Frontend `calculateSupplierRiskScore` + `useComplianceEngine` (current) | Assumed / Pending hardening | Collides with field name `riskScore`; FE may override BE | N/A | Not golden oracle |
| Compliance riskScore persisted | stored supplier fields | backend `compliance_suppliers` via payload clamp | Confirmed persistence SoT | Not calculation SoT; may differ from UI displayed score | N/A | Persistence only |
| Compliance resilienceScore persisted | stored supplier fields | backend `compliance_suppliers` via payload clamp | Confirmed persistence SoT | FE recalculates on read; formula alignment pending | compliance_resilience_score_basic | C.13.1C-f1B |
| Compliance resilienceScore calculated | UI resilience metric | Frontend `calculateResilienceScore` (current) | Assumed / Pending alignment | Differs from golden formula | compliance_resilience_score_basic | Subphase after naming |
| Compliance evidence | evidence/reviews | backend compliance services | Assumed / Pending C.13 validation | | N/A | |
| Governance decisions | decision workflow state | backend governance services | Assumed / Pending C.13 validation | Approve UX gaps | N/A | Strong backend per C.5 |
| PMI case dashboard | workstreams, ledger in case | pmi_cases JSON payload | Assumed / Pending C.13 validation | mergeWithDemo contamination | N/A | C.13.6 target |
| PMI enterprise synergies | synergy initiatives table | pmi_synergy_initiatives | Assumed / Pending C.13 validation | Not synced with case ledger | pmi_synergy_* | Dual model |
| Bridge signals | recalculated signals | bridge_signals + engine heuristics | Human review required | Heuristic not certified | bridge_priority_score_basic | |
| Bridge marketplace | opportunities | bridge_opportunities + DEMO fallback | Known demo/fallback contamination risk | Unlisted route | N/A | Do not promote |
| Risk register | likelihood x impact | Pending C.13 audit | Source unclear | | risk_score_likelihood_impact_basic | |
| Reporting KPIs | variance metrics | Pending C.13 audit | Source unclear | | reporting_kpi_variance_basic | |
| Executive Overview | module health / radar | Aggregator from module summaries | Assumed / Pending C.13 validation | Fallback if API fails | executive_module_health_average_basic | Not master store |
| Golden Datasets | calculation oracles | docs/testing/golden_inputs.json | Confirmed baseline seed | Implementation may mismatch | All IDs in file | Oracle not product data |
| Formulas | formula definitions | docs/testing/FORMULA_REGISTRY.md | Created IA-2 / Pending C.13 validation | | Mapped IDs | |

## Rules

1. One business value must have one official source-of-truth.
2. If frontend and backend disagree, classify P0 or P1 by business impact.
3. Do not silently switch source-of-truth in a patch.
4. Do not treat Executive Overview as master storage for operational entities.
5. Do not treat demo/fallback/localStorage as real persisted enterprise data in reports or board packs.
6. Do not mark Assumed architecture as Confirmed before C.13 code audit.
7. Any change to source-of-truth requires registry update in same PR or follow-up doc commit.

## Compliance Scoring Source-of-Truth (Decision C.13.1C-f1B — Option C Hybrid)

### weightedRiskScore

| Aspect | Decision |
|---|---|
| **Canonical definition** | `docs/testing/golden_inputs.json` + `docs/testing/FORMULA_REGISTRY.md` (`COMPLIANCE_WEIGHTED_RISK`) |
| **Formula** | `financialRisk*0.4 + jurisdictionRisk*0.4 + evidenceRisk*0.2` |
| **Implementation** | **Pending** — no production helper yet |
| **Usage** | Reports, benchmarks, golden tests, explicable DSS |
| **Must not** | Be confused with `operationalRiskScore` or legacy field `riskScore` |

### operationalRiskScore

| Aspect | Decision |
|---|---|
| **Current implementation** | Frontend engine (`complianceScoring.js`, orchestrated by `useComplianceEngine.js`) |
| **Authoritative for** | Operational dashboard signals today (interim) |
| **Not final** | Backend is not calculation SoT; naming/precedence cleanup pending (C13-P1-06) |
| **Must not** | Be treated as Golden `weightedRiskScore` (68-style oracle) |

### Persisted riskScore / resilienceScore (backend fields)

| Aspect | Decision |
|---|---|
| **Backend role** | **Persistence SoT** — stores and clamps values from API payload |
| **Backend does not** | Compute weighted or operational formulas today |
| **UI risk** | Displayed values may be FE-recalculated, not equal to persisted SQLite values |

### Future decisions required (documented, not implemented)

1. Whether backend should become calculation SoT for `operationalRiskScore` / aligned `resilienceScore`.
2. How UI labels **persisted** vs **calculated** scores (product truthfulness).
3. Whether to add explicit `weightedRiskScore` on reports/API without renaming operational engine in same PR.

Status: **Human review required** for pilot-facing exports until f2/f3 phases complete.

## Executive Overview Special Rule

Executive Overview reads module summaries and may show blended scores.

It must remain a read-mostly aggregation layer unless an explicit authorized workflow writes elsewhere.

Status: Assumed / Pending C.13 validation.

## Bridge Marketplace Special Rule

`/bridge/marketplace` data may show DEMO_BRIDGE fallback.

Status: Known demo/fallback contamination risk.

Not a source-of-truth for production pilot narrative.

## Next Step

C.13.0 and C.13.1–C.13.8 must validate this registry against actual code paths, stores, APIs, and tests.

Update status fields from Assumed to Confirmed, Mismatch, or Known duplicate risk only with audit evidence.
